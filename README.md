- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **QuantumBlock Quest**
 <p>Module 1

Our Project consists of a Web-based graphical interface, in which you need to connect and log in to the required URL. Here our First activity will be a hill cipher type game, which is a storytelling game. The second activity will be basic blockchain mechanics.

How to play

The person should be responsible for having basic knowledge of Blockchain Transactions and a high IQ to solve riddles based on military equipment to break a scheme. When the scheme is broken, the player finds a key that helps them to move forward in the story.

Requirements

At the start of the project, you should put our website URL, which is www.iam.com (not real). Then the interface will be shown, and if you want to login or signup by clicking on them, you have to put your username and password. After that, two game options will be shown. The first is Quantum Quest, based on an encryption and decryption method, and an interesting storyline with the effect of a typewriter going on. For this, you have the ability to break the code by solving riddles. This contains 5 levels. The other game is a blockchain game that can only show the transaction history with a static memory, and if the user exits the game, all data of the blockchain will be removed.

Features

Both games contain the basic concepts of DSA, a binary search element in which the shifting of elements changes the game. Arrays concept, loops, structures, functions, DSA, and more importantly, file handling.

Limitations & Future Enhancement

Limitations:

- Did not include all ASCII code.
- It might have errors.
- The code is too long.

Future Enhancements:

- We can add the structure of different storylines and define conditions in them.
- All ASCII code characters will be involved.
- Having a graphical interface.
- Having a dynamic string code of the storyline to be conveyed with the situations.
- Transaction history in blockchain.
